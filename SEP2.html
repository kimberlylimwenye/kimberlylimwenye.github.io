								<h2>overview</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Developed as part of the SEP2 module, focusing on sustainable food packaging.</li>
									<li>It features an inkjet-based 2D food printer that prints food labels with food grade ink and a machine that coats the food with wax to ensure the labels remain intact.</li>
									<li>The food printer can be any standard food printer, while the machine's physical structure utilizes T-slot profiles, PLA filament (a thermoplastic used in 3D printing), acrylic, and stainless steel rods and metal components.</li>
									<li>The machine is controlled by an Arduino Mega. 
										<u2>
											<p>	</p><li>Code is developed in C++.</li>
											<p>	</p><li>Motors are driven by motor drivers and TT motors, which communicate with the Arduino Mega.</li>
											<p>	</p><li>Ultrasonic sensors are used to prevent collisions with any part of the machine during operation.</li>

								<h2>Problem Space and Existing Solutions</h2>
								<p>Next, we turned our attention to the problem space. Our domain analysis revealed a significant issue concerning information accessibility on products for visually impaired individuals. Product descriptions exist to communicate the features and benefits of a product in writing. However, it was found that 9 out of 10 visually impaired individuals reported difficulty in reading medication or food label information. This difficulty impacts their safety, integrity, and quality of life.</p>
								<P>Our identified problem is that detailed product information is printed in small text on the product itself, making it inaccessible for visually impaired individuals. Our opportunity lies in enabling these individuals to access important product information.</P>
								<p>Existing market solutions targeting this problem include braille embossers and Navilens. Braille embossers create elevated surfaces on paper, translating information into braille language. Navilens, on the other hand, scans an area using a phone and translates the information into spoken language.</p>
								<p>We decided to lean towards the direction of braille embossers. Navilens depends on smartphones, which can be a barrier for users who might not own them and also relies on the smartphoneâ€™s battery life. Furthermore, audio information is slower than tactile reading, and traditional braille is preferred by many visually impaired individuals for tasks involving reading and writing.</p>

								<h2>Evaluating Technology</h2>
								<p>Our team delved into the capabilities of 2D food printing systems, such as inkjet printers, and found that they are unable to perform the function of extruding Braille onto any surface. This limitation is primarily due to the absence of Z-axis movement, which is crucial for creating the tactile nature of Braille.</p>
								<p><b>Thermal Radiation Curing technology</b> has the ability to create elevated surfaces, a critical requirement for Braille. This is achieved by layering the heat cured ink in a precise manner, allowing for the creation of 3D structures, including the raised dots of Braille.
									However, thermal radiation curing requires high heat, which could potentially affect the food packaging. Packaging materials often have specific temperature thresholds, beyond which they can deform or even melt. This could compromise the integrity of the packaging and, in turn, the safety of the food product inside. The process of thermal radiation curing is time-consuming. The curing process, which solidifies the material, requires a significant amount of time under high heat. This could slow down the production process and reduce the efficiency of our system.
								</p>
								<p><b>Ultraviolet Light Curing technology</b> has the ability to create elevated surfaces, a critical requirement for Braille. This is achieved by layering the resin in a precise manner, allowing for the creation of 3D structures, including the raised dots of Braille.
									One of the primary concerns with UV light curing is its potential to cause damage to the food packaging. Prolonged exposure to UV light can degrade certain materials, leading to discoloration and loss of structural integrity. This could compromise the safety and quality of the food product.
									Furthermore, UV light can be harmful to human health, causing skin burns and eye injuries. This raises safety concerns for the operators of the system
								</p>
								<p><b>Binder jetting technology</b> has the ability to create elevated surfaces, a critical requirement for Braille. This is achieved by layering the concrete powder in a precise manner, allowing for the creation of 3D structures, including the raised dots of Braille.
									The binder jetting process only requires water to bind the concrete powder together. This simplicity makes it an efficient and cost-effective solution, as it eliminates the need for additional binding agents or complex procedures.</p>
								<p>Based on all the information, <b>binder jetting technology was chosen</b> for its ability to create three-dimensional structures necessary for Braille, its efficiency and simplicity, its safety advantages, and its respect for the integrity of the food packaging. It offers a promising solution to enhance information accessibility for visually impaired individual.</p>
